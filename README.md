# dotfiles-vim


## Setup

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.homeshick/repos/homeshick
git clone https://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git ~/.homeshick/repos/homeshick
source ~/.homesick/repos/homeshick/homeshick.sh
homeshick link dotfiles-vim
```


## Usage

The config files are self explanatory, however I am trying to build some [docs]
based on use cases focused on development . This takes a considerable amount of
time, so don't be surprised if things are missing.


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, just let me know first please.
